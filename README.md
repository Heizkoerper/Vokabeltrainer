# Vokabeltrainer

This is a vocabulary trainer that I created together with @SpotlightForBugs for CS class. I have decided to coninue it personally. The original version can be found on @SpotlightForBugs GitHub under github.com/spotlightforbugs/vokabeltrainer.

This project does contain code from @SpotlightForBugs and I want to give him credit for it.
